The USER button connects to GPIO22 on the Pico W which allows it to be programmed for various purposes. The RESET button does just what its name suggests and resets the entire board when pressed. This can help to reboot the robot or to restart a sequence you want the Robotics Kit to perform. Holding the BOOTSEL button either when plugging in a USB cable or when pressing the RESET button sets the Pico W to behave as a mass storage device when connected to a computer for uploading firmware. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"single_page/#leds_1","title":"LEDs","text":"<p>There are three LEDs on the XRP Controller - Beta labeled MOT, SYS, and LED. </p> <p></p> <p>These LEDs provide a visual indication to the user. The LEDs labeled MOT and SYS turn on when their respective power rails are powered. The MOT LED turns on when the motors have power available. The SYS LED turns on when the 3.3V/System circuit is powered. This circuit powers the Pico W, sensors, and the expansion connectos. The LED on the Pico W labeled LED is a user-programmable status LED you can program for whatever behavior you prefer. For example, you can have it turn on when the distance sensor reports a certain distance.  </p>"},{"location":"single_page/#solder-jumpers_1","title":"Solder Jumpers","text":"<p>Warning</p> <p>These solder jumpers can change the behavior of the board in a lasting way. Using these requires extra tools not included in the XRP  Kit - Beta along with knowledge of how to use and interact with solder jumpers. We recommend that only advanced users adjust and change the solder jumpers. If you'd like to learn more about how to use solder jumpers, check out SparkFun's How to Work with Jumper Pads and PCB Traces tutorial.</p> <p>Lastly, the XRP Controller - Beta has nine solder jumpers. A solder jumper provides a customization option for advanced users to control the behavior of the pins and components they connect to. The solder jumpers on this board are labeled (from top-to-bottom when looking at the photo below): VIN_MEAS, MOT_MODE_R/4, MOT_MODE_L/3, USER_BTN, I2C, IMU_ADR, SYS, MOT, and VUSB. </p> <p></p> Label Default State Function Notes VIN_MEAS CLOSED Completes the VIN circuit. Open to disrupt the VIN circuit to measure voltage on VIN with a multimeter. MOT_MODE_R/4 CLOSED Pulls the Right DRV8835's MODE pin to 3.3V. This sets the DRV8835 to run in PH/EN mode by default. Open to switch the DRV8835 to operate in IN/IN mode. MOT_MODE_L/3 CLOSED Pulls the Left DRV8835's MODE pin to 3.3V. This sets the DRV8835 to run in PH/EN mode by default. Open to switch the DRV8835 to operate in IN/IN mode. USER_BTN CLOSED Completes the User Button circuit to tie it to GPIO22. Open to disconnect the button from GPIO22. I2C CLOSED Pulls the SDA/SCL lines to 3.3V through two 2.2k\u03a9. Open completely to disable the pull up resistors on the I<sup>2</sup>C bus. IMU_ADR CLOSED Sets the IMU's I<sup>2</sup>C address to 0x6B. Open to switch the I<sup>2</sup>C address to 0x6A. SYS CLOSED Completes the SYS Power LED circuit. Open to disable the SYS Power LED. MOT CLOSED Completes the MOT Power LED circuit. Open to disable the MOT Power LED. VUSB CLOSED Completes the V_USB circuit to provide 5V and 3.3V to the board from USB. Open to prevent motors and servos from being powered by USB."},{"location":"single_page/#pinout-reference-table_1","title":"Pinout Reference Table","text":"<p>The table below offers a quick reference for the complete pinout on the XRP Controller - Beta and which pins they connect to on the Pico W. </p> Pico W GPIO Pin Connector Label Pin Function GPIO0 Motor 3 Motor 3 Encoder A GPIO1 Motor 3 Motor 3 Encoder B GPIO2 Motor 3 Motor 3 Phase Pin GPIO3 Motor 3 Motor 3 Enable Pin GPIO4 Motor L Left Motor Encoder A GPIO5 Motor L Left Motor Encoder B GPIO6 Motor L Left Motor Phase Pin GPIO7 Motor L Left Motor Enable Pin GPIO8 Motor 4 Motor 4 Encoder A GPIO9 Motor 4 Motor 4 Encoder B GPIO10 Motor 4 Motor 4 Phase Pin GPIO11 Motor 4 Motor 4 Enable Pin GPIO12 Motor R Right Motor Encoder A GPIO13 Motor R Right Motor Encoder B GPIO14 Motor R Right Motor Phase Pin GPIO15 Motor R Right Motor Enable Pin GPIO16 Servo 1 Servo 1 Signal Pin GPIO17 Servo 2 Servo 2 Signal Pin GPIO18 Qwiic Qwiic Data Signal for the IMU &amp; Qwiic Connector GPIO19 Qwiic Qwiic Clock Signal for the IMU &amp; Qwiic Connector GPIO20 Range Range Trigger Pin GPIO21 Range Range Echo Pin GPIO22 Extra User Button/Extra GPIO26 Line Line Follower Left Signal GPIO27 Line Line Follower Right Signal GPIO28 Extra VIN_Meas/Extra"},{"location":"single_page/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"<p>For more information about both versions of the XRP Controller covered in this document, take a look at the following resources:</p> <p>XRP Controller Resources</p> <ul> <li>Schematic (PDF)</li> <li>KiCad Files (ZIP)</li> <li>Board Dimensions</li> <li>RP2350 Datasheet</li> <li>DRV8411 Motor Driver Datasheet</li> <li>LSM6DSO 6 DoF IMU Datasheet</li> </ul> <p>XRP Controller - Beta Resources</p> <ul> <li>Schematic (PDF)</li> <li>Eagle Files (ZIP)</li> <li>Raspberry Pico W Datasheet</li> <li>DRV8835 Motor Driver Datasheet</li> <li>LSM6DSO 6 DoF IMU Datasheet</li> </ul> <p>General XRP Resources</p> <ul> <li>XRP Robotis Platform Home Page</li> <li>GitHub Hardware Repository</li> <li>XRP Chassis 3D Printing Files</li> </ul>"}]}
