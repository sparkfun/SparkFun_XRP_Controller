It combines a RP2040 processor with a wireless module for both 2.4GHz 802.11n wireless LAN and Bluetooth<sup>\u2122</sup> 5.2. The RP2040 communicates with the motor controllers, IMU and other components to control the robotics kit's behavior. The photo below highlights the Pico W on the Controller Board:</p> <p></p> <p>Think of the Pico W as a brain sending signals to other parts of the \"body\" to tell them what to do. It has several General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins that connect to the other major parts on this board so it can send and receive data from them and return it to you visually (such as seeing the motors move) or virtually (such as watching data on a computer monitor). </p>"},{"location":"hardware_overview/#drv8835-motor-drivers","title":"DRV8835 Motor Drivers","text":"<p>The pair of DRV8835 H-Bridge motor drivers on the XRP Controller Board control the direction and speed of the Robotics Kit's motors.</p> <p></p> <p>The term H-bridge comes from how this circuit design looks on a schematic diagram.

This connector mates with the cable from the XRP Kit's battery pack for battery-powered operation. Take note that the maximum safe voltage that can be applied to this connector is 11V though the 4-AA battery pack included with the kit supplies a maximum of 6V so most users will have no issues when it comes to going past the max voltage.</p>"},{"location":"hardware_overview/#pico-w-usb-connector","title":"Pico W USB-Connector","text":"<p>The Pico W has a Micro-USB connector that can be used to power the Controller Board with 5V from a USB cable.

These connectors include the power connections for the motor as well as the encoders on the motors. The board routes these connections through the motor drivers to GPIO pins on the Pico W. You'll use these pins to monitor how many rotations the motor completes and use that data to determine the speed of the motors. Refer to the Pinout table at the end of this document for the specific GPIO pins each motor connects to on the Pico W. The Controller Board has two extra motor connectors for expansion projects using more than two motors.</p>"},{"location":"hardware_overview/#servo-motor-connectors","title":"Servo Motor Connectors","text":"<p>The two three-pin connectors on either side of the board are extra connectors for expansion projects using servo motors. These connectors have power pins (5V and Ground) and a signal pin to control the motion of the servo motor. Servo motors use a communication method called pulse width modulation that tells the motor to move and with some motors, where to move to. If you're interested in learning more about how servo motors work, you may want to check out SparkFun's Servos Explained page for information and tutorials on how to use them.</p>"},{"location":"hardware_overview/#expansion-connectors","title":"Expansion Connectors","text":"<p>The Controller Board has four four-pin connectors labeled (from left to right when looking at the labels upright) Line, Extra, Qwiic, and Range. Their labels indicate their use as well as which GPIO pins they connect to on the Pico W. These connectors provide an easy plug-in connection for the line follower and distance sensor as well as two extra connectors for expansion projects. These connectors are polarized meaning they only work when connected properly but they are keyed and there is only one way to plug a cable into them.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"hardware_overview/#line-follower-connector","title":"Line Follower Connector","text":"<p>The Line connector is where you'll plug the cable for the line follower sensor into. This connects the sensor's two signal lines, Left and Right, to the Pico W's GPIO27 (Right) and GPIO26 (Left) pins. You'll use these pins to monitor whenever the sensor detects the robot has gone past the left or right threshold when performing line-following experiments.</p>"},{"location":"hardware_overview/#range-sensor-connector","title":"Range Sensor Connector","text":"<p>The Range connector is where you'll plug the cable for the ultrasonic range sensor into.

Note, these pins are shared with other functionality on the XRP Controller Board. GPIO28 is shared with the VIN Measure pin which lets you measure the voltage level on VIN so you can monitor the remaining battery charge. GPIO22 is shared with the User Button. Both pins' primary functions can be disabled with the solder jumpers, refer to the Solder Jumpers section below for more information.</p>"},{"location":"hardware_overview/#buttons","title":"Buttons","text":"<p>The Controller Board has two push buttons labeled USER and RESET. The USER button connects to GPIO22 on the Pico W which allows it to be programmed for various purposes. The RESET button does just what its name suggests and resets the entire board when pressed.

The LEDs labeled MOT and SYS turn on when their respective power rails are powered. The MOT LED turns on when the motors have power available. The SYS LED turns on when the 3.3V/System circuit is powered. This circuit powers the Pico W, sensors, and the expansion connectos. The LED on the Pico W labeled LED is a user-programmable status LED you can program for whatever behavior you prefer. For example, you can have it turn on when the distance sensor reports a certain distance.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware_overview/#solder-jumpers","title":"Solder Jumpers","text":"<p>Warning</p> <p>These solder jumpers can change the behavior of the board in a lasting way.
